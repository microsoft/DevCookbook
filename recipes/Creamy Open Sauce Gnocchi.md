# Creamy Open Sauce Gnocchi

> These Gnocchi are the last you will ever need to fork.

## Ingredients

- 500 g (or ~18 oz) of Gnocchi
- 200 ml (or ~1 cup) of cream
- 1 slice of Gorgonzola (~200 g or 7 oz)

## Directions

1. Start melting the Gorgonzola in a pan on medium to high.
2. While waiting, put on water to boil.
3. When the Gorgonzola is mostly melted, add the cream to the pan. Adjust heat to keep it bubbling.
4. When the water is boiling, salt it and add the gnocchi.
5. Let the sauce thicken up while waiting for the gnocchi to float on top of the water.
6. Take out the gnocchi and add them to the sauce.
7. If you're into it, add some salad as side dish. Serve and enjoy.
