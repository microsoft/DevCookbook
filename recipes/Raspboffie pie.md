# Raspboffie pie

> What's better than a Banoffie pie? Something less sickly with sharp raspberries instead of bananas to cut through the sweetness of the caramel.

## Ingredients

- 1 pack Digestive biscuits
- 100g Butter
- 1 Can of Sweetened condensed milk
- 1 small punnet raspberries
- 250ml Whipping cream
- Good quality hot chocolate powder

## Directions

1. Place the can of condensed milk still unopened in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil and simmer for 3 hours, making sure the can is always covered with water - top up with boiling water if needed.

1. Whilst the condensed milk is boiling, make the pie base:

    1. Grease a pie dish with butter

    1. Put the digestive biscuits in a plastic bag and smash and roll with a rolling pin till you have fine crumbs

    1. Melt a small amount of butter in a pan and mix in the biscuit crumbs. You need enough butter for the crumbs to stick together, but not too much, so keep adding small bits of butter as needed until the crumbs start to bind.

    1. Spread the crumbs into the pie dish and press them firmly to the bottom and sides to make a pie base

    1. Put in the fridge till the butter cools and sets

1. Once the condensed milk has finished it's 3 hours of boiling, take it off the heat and remove the can from the water. Leave to cool for 20 minutes or so, then open with a can opener. The contents will be a sticky caramel.

    > **Be warned** - the contents will be very hot and very sticky, so use oven gloves

1. Spread the caramel evenly into the pie base and chill until cold

1. Cover the caramel with raspberries

1. Whip the cream with a couple of spoons of hot chocolate power (add more to taste) to make a thick chocolate cream and spread on top.

1. Eat and enjoy!
